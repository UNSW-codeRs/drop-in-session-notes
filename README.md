# Drop-in session notes

In this repository I am adding some answers and notes for questions from colleagues and friends, and from the UNSW codeRs drop-in sessions. I hope these might be useful for other users, as templates for other Q&A sessions or as a starting point for more comprehensive tutorials/how-to's.

Each note is written as a R-markdown document with a minimal reproducible example and a knitr PDF version that includes the R-session information useful for debugging purposes.
